# Task Manager with Firebase Authentication

This is a React-based task management application that allows users to manage their tasks. It includes features like adding, editing, deleting, and completing tasks. The application supports task filtering based on completion status and persists task data using local storage. Users can sign in with Google using Firebase authentication, ensuring that each user's tasks are stored separately.

## Features

- Add a task with a title, description, due date, and priority level.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed or active.
- Filter tasks by all, completed, or active status.
- User authentication with Google.
- Persistent task data in local storage specific to each user.
- Drag-and-drop functionality for task reordering.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Firebase for authentication
- react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop functionality
- Local Storage for data persistence
